# UFOs

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to apply HTML and Bootstrap skills to create a table to organize UFO data that is stored in a JavaScript array.  The table will be displayed using HTML code and will also have the ability to filter data based on specific criteria.

### Resources
+ data.js
+ Visual Studio Code 1.76

## Results 
The table we created can be filtered 5 ways: by date, by city, by state, by country, and by shape.

To apply the filter for date, type in the date for the UFO sighting you are interested in and press 'Enter':

Only the UFO sightings on the date chosen will be displayed after pressing Enter.

To reset the filter, click on 'UFO Sightings' at the top of the page.

If a filter criteria is chosen that does not have a UFO sighting, the table will be blank after pressing Enter:

(table display after searching for 'nd' in the 'State' filter)

## Summary

### Drawback
+ One drawback of this webpage is there is no way to know which filter criteria are represented in the table without scrolling through the entire table.  It would be nice to know which states, countries, and shapes are available to be searched.  I wouldn't want a user to search for a state that is not represented.

### Recommendations
+ A recommendation to fix the drawback mentioned would be to have drop-down windows in the filter boxes so that a user can click on the drop-drown box and see exactly which states, countries, and shapes are represented in the table.  This would eliminate a user searching for a shape that isn't present, such as an 'octagon'.

+ Another recommendation would be to have a way for users to report new, or unreported, UFO sightings.  This could be accomplished by providing a link that would redirect the user to a form to fill-out, or the form could even be provided at the bottom of the page.  Having some way for users to report new UFO sightings would incentivize users to visit the page and drive traffic.  The form could look something like this:
